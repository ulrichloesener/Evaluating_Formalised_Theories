# Evaluating Formalised Theories - Master's Thesis
Here you can find the code for models and figures of my master's thesis.
I also updloaded a pdf of all figures used in the paper.

The thesis is concerned with the formalisation of verbal theories in psychology (i.e., "translating" them into computational/mathematical language). Also, the evaluation of such theories using different types of data and data models is assessed. Both simulated and (publicly available) empirical data is used in the study. Instructions to reproduce the results of the thesis are as follows:

The file "Formal_models1&2.Rmd" contains the coded needed for model building. This needs to be run first.
The file "Figures.Rmd" contains the code necessary to produce all the figures used in the paper. This reproduces all figures used in the paper.
The folder "Figures_thesis" contains pdfs of all the figures used in the paper.

For the last figure, empirical data from the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (2001-2003; CPES) needs to be downloaded from https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/20240#. This study adhered to the ethical guidelines of the Center for Multicultural Mental Health Research at Cambridge Health Alliance. Please select SPSS data format to sucessfully load the data to R (see code). The use of this data for this thesis has been approved by the Ethical Review Board of the Faculty of Social and Behavioural Sciences at Utrecht University. 

All analyses were carried out using the "Bird Hippie" version 4.1.2 (2021) of RStudio on Windows 10.
