Here you can find the code for models and figures of my master's thesis.
I also updloaded a pdf of all figures used in the paper.

The file "Formal_models1&2.Rmd" contains the coded needed for model building. First, you need to run this.
The file "Figures.Rmd" contains the code necessary to produce all the figures used in the paper.
The folder "Figures_thesis" contains pdfs of all the figures used in the paper.

For the last figure, empirical data from the CPES study needs to be downloaded from https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/20240#
Please select SPSS data format to sucessfully load the data to R (see code). 

All analyses were carried out using the "Bird Hippie" version 4.1.2 (2021) of RStudio on Windows 10.
